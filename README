This package contains the canonical URI parser for the `x-freq:`
URI scheme. This scheme is documented here:

WHY
===

The incentive for using this code instead of rolling your own
`x-freq` URI parser is that implementing a correct URI parser is a
deceivingly difficult task. I wrote this because I didn't want
everyone that wanted to use the `x-freq` URI in their programs to
end up writing their own slightly broken parsers. People invariably
tend to not read specs for this sort of thing and just go on their
gut.  I'd like to avoid that by providing this canonical implementation
to the public domain. You are free to use and abuse this source
code to your heart's content, with or without attribution.

To put it bluntly, this code is far more likely to be correct than
what you would likely write in a short period of time. If you want
to use `x-freq` in your C program, at least use this code as a starting
point.

improvements, check out the project page on Github:

How To Use It
=============

The most important function is `freq_parse_uri()`. It takes
c-string+length input arguments (which describe the URI) and two
output arguments which are pointers to `freq_t` structs. Here is
the prototype:

	extern int freq_parse_uri(
		const char* uri,
		size_t len,
		freq_t* rx_freq,
		freq_t* tx_freq
	);

The `freq_t` struct contains the information parsed out of the URI.
There are two of them to account for URIs which describe different
receive (RX) and transmit (TX) parameters.

The `freq_t` struct looks like this:

	typedef struct {
		uint32_t freq;          //!^ in Hertz
		freq_mod_t mod;
		uint32_t bandwidth[2];  //!^ For AM and SB only
		uint16_t deviation;     //!^ For FM only
		uint16_t ctcss;         //!^ in 1/10ths of a Hertz
		uint16_t dcs;
		uint32_t power;         //!^ in milliwatts
	} freq_t;

As you can see it is fairly straight-forward. The bandwidth parameter
is split into two parts for the bandwidth below (index zero) and
above (index one) the carrier frequency.

The modulation (mod) parameter is an enum with the following
definition:

	typedef enum {
		FREQ_MOD_UNDEFINED=0,
		FREQ_MOD_UNKNOWN=1,
		FREQ_MOD_AM=2,
		FREQ_MOD_FM=3,
		FREQ_MOD_SB=4,
		FREQ_MOD_CW=5,
	} freq_mod_t;

Adding Support for New Query Parameters
=======================================

Adding support for new query parameters is very easy. First,
update `freq_t` to contain the new parameter you want to support.
Then edit the `parse_query_param()` function in `freq-uri.c` to
include support for parsing the new parameter. You don't have to
worry about splitting for RX/TX or worry about percent-decoding
anything, that is all handled for you automatically.
