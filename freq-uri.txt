-----

Over the past few weeks, I've been thinking that it would be useful
to have a URI format for describing a radio frequency or channel.
Such a URI scheme would be useful for hyperlinking to a specific
frequency from a link and for exchanging radio frequency lists
between devices, programs, and people. (Think QR-codes)

I looked around to see if such a URI scheme had been developed, but
I couldn't find anything. Since I think such a scheme would be
useful, and I would like to use such a scheme in the future, I
decided to go ahead and throw together an informal proposal for
what such a scheme would look like and how it would work.

For now the scheme identifier is "`x-freq`" because it is experimental
at this point. If this scheme is ever formalized into a real standard
then the "`x-`" prefix would be dropped.

Here are the use cases that I would like to be able to specify this
this URI scheme, along with some examples:

 * A specific single frequency.
   Ex: <x-freq:107.9m>
 * A frequency with a repeater input shift.
   Ex: <x-freq:145.23m-0.6>
 * Split receive and transmit frequencies.
   Ex: <x-freq:145.93m/435.75>
 * Modulation type and other parameters.
   Ex: <x-freq:145.23m-0.6?m=fm;dv=5;ts=100>

## Augmented BNF ##

[ABNF](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2234.txt) is a formal language
for describing syntax. Here is the ABNF for the x-freq URI scheme:

	frequri	= 'x-freq:' freqcomp [ '?' querycomp ]
	freqcomp	= freq [ shift / split ]
	freq	= float [ unit ]
	shift	= ( "+" / "-" ) freq
	split	= "/" freq
	float   = 1*DIGIT / ( *DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT )
	unit	= 'h' / 'k' / 'm' / 'g' / 't'
	querycomp	= pair *( ";" pair )
	pair	= key "=" value
	key		= keyfirst *( keychar )	
	keyfirst = ( ALPHA / '_' / ':' )
	keychar	= ( keyfirst / DIGIT / '-' / '.' )
	value	= *( unreserved / pct-encoded ) [ '/' *( unreserved / pct-encoded ) ]

The *primary frequency* of a URI is the first frequency in the URL
and represents the RX frequency. If no 'shift' or 'split' is
specified, the primary frequency is both the RX and TX frequency(if
applicable).

If the TX frequency is different than the primary frequency, it may
be represented relative to the primary frequency (shift) or explicitly
specified as a full frequency (split). For example, both of the
following URI's represent the same thing:

 * <x-freq:145.23m-0.6> (Shift notation)
 * <x-freq:145.23m/144.63> (Split notation)

Shift notation is useful for specifying repeaters which use separate
input and output frequencies. Split notation is useful when the RX
and TX frequencies are on entirely different bands—which is common
for satellite communications:

 * <x-freq:145.93m/435.75>

The default unit for the primary frequency (when unspecified) is
kilohertz. The default unit for any other frequency in the URI
matches the unit of the primary frequency unless specified otherwise.
The unit of a frequency can be specified by appending a unit code
suffix. The units are:

 * `h` — Hertz
 * `k` — Kilohertz
 * `m` — Megahertz
 * `g` — Gigahertz
 * `t` — Terrahertz

## Query Component ##

The query component of the URI is used to specify additional
parameters about the channel, such as modulation, bandwidth, CTCSS
tones, etc. Here are the query parameters specified so far:

 * "`m`" : Modulation
 * "`bw`" : Channel spectrum bandwidth for `am` and `sb` modulation.
 * "`dv`" : Carrier frequency deviation for `fm` modulation.
 * "`ts`" : CTCSS/PL Tone (In Hz)
 * "`dcs`" : Digital Code Squelch
 * "`std`" : Modulation scheme (ex: NTSC, PAL, ...)
 * "`tp`" : Transmit Power (in watts)

Most query parameters do not have any pre-defined default values.
If the parameter is absent from the URI, then the default value of
the parameter is implementation-specific.

Any query parameters which are unrecognized by an application should
be ignored.

### Split parameters ###

Section added 2011-10-27.

Sometimes you may need different values for the parameters for TX
and RX. In those cases, you can explicitly specify separate TX or
RX values by separating them with a '/' character. Just like split
notation, the RX value is first, and the TX value is second. Keep
in mind that for some parameters (like transmit power) this makes
no sense.

### `m` - Modulation ###

Currently, this query component can be one of the following values:

 * `am` : Dual-Side-Band w/ Carrier.
 * `fm` : Frequency Modulation
 * `sb` : Side-Band(s) w/ Suppressed Carrier (Includes USB/LSB/DSB)
 * `cw` : Constant-Wave (For morse-code, on-off keying, etc)

### `bw` - Spectrum Bandwidth ###

Describes the total spectrum bandwidth used, centered on the primary
frequency. Note that this parameter is only used for `am` and `sb`
modulations. For `fm` modulation, you use `dv` (deviation).

In some cases, such as SSB and VSB modulation, the bandwidth is not
symmetric on either side of the carrier. In these cases you can
specify the bandwidth used below and above the carrier, separated
with a "`:`" character. This allows us to specify a rich set of
modulations (Like USB, LSB, VSB, DSBSC, etc.) with only two query
components:

 * `?m=sb;bw=4:` &nbsp; (Lower Side-Band (LSB), 4kHz)
 * `?m=sb;bw=:4` &nbsp; (Upper Side-Band (USB), 4kHz)
 * `?m=sb;bw=2:4` &nbsp; (Vestigial Side-Band w/ Suppressed Carrier)
 * `?m=am;bw=1.5m:4.5` &nbsp; (Vestigial Side-Band w/ Carrier)

Note that `bw=30` and `bw=15:15` mean the same thing.

You can specify fun things like inverting linear transponders using
this notation. For example, ARRISAT-1 has a 16kHz inverting linear
transponder. It could be described with the following x-freq URI:

 * <x-freq:145.9220m/435.7580?bw=:16/16:>

### `dv` - Carrier frequency deviation ###

Describes the maximum deviation from the carrier when using frequency
modulation.

### `ubw`/`lbw` - Upper/Lower Spectrum Bandwidth ###

The `ubw` and `lbw` parameters have been merged into the `bw`
parameter above.

These parameters allow you to specify the bandwidth more specifically
than you can with the `bw` parameter, by allowing you to specify
the bandwidth used above and below the carrier. If only one is
specified, the other parameter is assumed to be zero.

For FM, the primary frequency represents the *nominal center
frequency* of the carrier, whereas with AM and SB modulations the
primary frequency describes *where the carrier actually is* (or
where it would be, if suppressed). This distinction is important
because with AM and SB *the carrier isn't always at the center of
the used bandwidth*. Sometimes the carrier is at the bottom (USB),
or at the top (LSB), or just off-kilter (VSB). The `ubw` and `lbw`
parameters allow you to specify how large each sideband is around
the carrier.

NOTE: These parameters only make sense with AM and SB modulations.
Use of these parameters with FM and CW modulations is invalid.

If both of these parameters are set to the same value, you can
shorten the URI by adding the two parameters together and using the
`bw` parameter.

### `ts` - CTCSS/PL Tone ###

This specifies the "Tone Squelch" baseband frequency in Hertz.
Commonly used on repeaters. For TX this tone will be added when
transmitting. For RX, the received signal will be squelched if the
given CTCSS done is not present ("tone squelch").

### `dcs` - Digital Code Squelch ###

This specifies the code for "Digital Code Squelch". This is the
digital version of CTCSS. Not as common, but included here for
completeness sake. Same TX/RX logic applies here as it does to the
`ts` parameter.

### `std` - Modulating Standard ###

This parameter describes the *modulating standard*. You would use
this parameter to describe the standard being used for this channel.
For example, for a TV signal this could be [`ntsc`](wikipedia:NTSC),
`ntsc-j`,[`pal`](wikipedia:PAL), [`atsc`](wikipedia:ATSC), etc.

It can also be used as a simple way to describe standardized digital
modes, like [`afsk1200`](wikipedia:Bell_202_modem), `dfsk9600`,
[`802.15.4`](wikipedia:802.11), [`802.11`](wikipedia:802.11), etc.

When you use this parameter, you generally don't need to use the
other parameters like `m` or `bw`, as these parameters would be
implied by the standard being referenced. Any parameter which is
specified will over-ride any defaults associated with indicated
modulation standard.

### `tp` - Transmit Power

This parameter may be used to specify the transmit power that should
be used for transmitting using this URI. It is specified in watts.

## Other Examples

 * "N6NFI/R":   <x-freq:145.23m-0.6?m=fm;dv=5;ts=100>
 * "APRS raw": <x-freq:144390?m=fm>
 * "APRS ops": <x-freq:144390?m=fm;ts=100;std=afsk1200:ax.25>
 * "ARISSat-1,TL": <x-freq:145.93m/435.75?bw=16>
   (or, more accurately, <x-freq:145.922m/435.758?bw=:16/16:>)
 * "WWRQ": <x-freq:107.9m?m=fm;dv=75>
 * NTSC Ch 3: <x-freq:61.25m?std=ntsc>
   * Video: <x-freq:61.25m?m=am;bw=1.5m:4.5>
   * Audio: <x-freq:65.75m?m=fm;dv=25>

Here are some real-world examples using the [WB6ECE Repeater
Group](http://www.wb6ece.org/):

 * Voted, linked input:
   <x-freq:441.3m+5?m=fm;dv=5;ts=100>
 * Allison Site Only:
   <x-freq:441.3m+5?m=fm;dv=5;ts=100/110.9>
 * Woodside Site Only:
   <x-freq:441.3m+5?m=fm;dv=5;ts=100/123.0>

### Non-radio examples ###

This URI scheme can also be used to describe baseband signals as
well:

 * FM Stereo Diff: <x-freq:38?m=sb;bw=30>
 * RBDS: <x-freq:57?m=sb;bw=1.65>
 * Old long-distance idle signal: <x-freq:2.6?m=cw> :D

## A few important points ##

One of the things you may notice is missing from this URI scheme
is the leading double-slash (`//`). In URLs these characters denote
the *authority component* of the URL, which contains information
like the hostname, username, IP port, etc. Since none of that is
relevant to this URI scheme, I have omitted it.

Most importantly, the following usage is an *abomination* and should
*never* be used:

 * x-freq://145.23m-0.6                      (DON'T DO THIS!)

Also note that the character to separate the query component
parameters is ';' instead of '&'. This allows the scheme to be used
in XML and HTML documents without doing any escaping.

## Wrapping-up ##

This URI scheme allows you to specifically describe the fundamental
parameters of a radio channel: RX frequency, TX frequency, modulation,
bandwidth, and other parameters. I believe it to be concise, flexible,
and human-readable.
